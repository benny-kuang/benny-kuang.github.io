# 八十二街

---

The summer days...walking down forest pathways...biking round and round and round...hearing the clangs of the metal pot splashing into water being poured out throughout our backyard yard...the soft sweet soil permeates in the summer sky.

Ice cream sandwiches and Flintstone pushpops from Sun's Market...Custard buns, egg & ham, and hot dogs wrapped in a fluffy soft bread. Cream swirled cakes -- looking into the display case with the decadent cream and fruit covered birthday cakes. Jumping down the backdoor steps of King's Bakery rushing up to my Grandpa telling him that it is time to head home. He sits among a crowd of onlooking 公公s slamming down the wooden Xiangqi piece and claiming another enemy soldier. "Ah, you made the wrong move", "Heh you really got him now" -- the spectators chime with plastic cups filled with a mixture of Lipton tea and condensed milk. "Just watch, just watch", my Grandpa replies.

Bus stops -- forest -- fabric seats -- Gameboy -- long routes with 8-bit soundtracks --  random encounters -- Clackamas Town Center -- Lloyd Center -- Mall 205 -- Burker King -- paper passes with hole punches which we cover up when we board the bus to hide that they have expired. Napkins that would be stowed away. "Remember to say that you are 5" (I was actually 7). Ninja Turtles arcade machine at "Chunky Chee", 3D Pac Man, Animontronics, spider stomping, alligators that stick their heads out and get rightfully bonked with a plastic mallet. These are the sweet sweet memories.

That time my grandpa let in a stranger into our home so that they could make a phone call.  Coming through our screen door which had taped up holes to prevent flies from entering. Which had to be a certain way otehrwise it will derail completely and I will have to plea for help and feel the shame and embarassment as they would chastize, "Why can't you do things on your own? You are big enough to know better now". 

Who is this 鬼佬？ Are they dangerous? I stared silently as they made their call. Who did they call? Did they make it back home safely? Did they have a home? Nevertheless they left and I never knew whatever happened. 

The big black TV we had in the living room, the slow static sound it would make when you turned it on -- slow fading images would come into view. TVB broadcasts, KGW, OPB, Sesame Street, Days of our Lives, come back a bit early and this guy would be painting silently? How boring, hurry up and end so I can watch Arthur!

Sneaking into my parent's room on Saturday mornings so that I could put in the tape to record the newest episode of yugioh while I was at Chinese school. The winding road down Burnside, crossing the Steel Bridge. Climbing up the musty stairs, writing out broken chinese characters with on the ancient chalk board. "譚老師早上！” we rose up and said in unison. I in the English speaking class among the adopted Chinese kids -- those whose white parents wanted them to reconnect to their "roots" -- while all my other friends were put into the class where the teacher only spoke in Cantonese. "譚老師再見" we would say as class was dismissed. I meet up with friends in the other class seeing that their teacher had given them gummy watches as a reward this week. Our reward was to write Chapter 5 10 times before next Saturday.

The rare days we would not have school -- staying up late the night before being able to watch all the late night shows -- Leno, COnan, Letterman...the infomerials that would play once all the night programming have ended -- Walkaway Cookwares, just set it and forget it. Remembering those sex hotline commercials -- with their sultry voices beckoning you to "push those hard buttons" on ur phone...The heart pounding when I once out of curiosity dialed the number, only to hear an automated voice. A voyeurism peering into through the ssssss of channels. Typing "asinavenue.com" instead of "asianvenue.com" takes you to a page full of nude busty women. The heart pounding as I rushed my mouse to close the window. Peering over my back if there was anyone else that noticed. The voyeurism as I typed my typo discovery again when the coast was clear. 

These are the sweet sweet memories...
