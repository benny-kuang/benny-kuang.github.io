# 八十二街
## By Benny Kuang 

---

The door hinges open -- a soft release air -- *psst* -- as it closes shut. Sprinkles of embers burn along the paper of the cigarette. A hand pulls it back, grizzly bits of hair litter the recently shaven face of the old man.  A pause as he slowly releases the smoke of tobacco into the faint summer breeze. Pacing back and forth, I stare down at my feet hearing the *click click click* as my shoes make contact on the small cement walkway, imagining that I am marching soldier preparing for a daunting mission. I stop and look at the old man, his oversized jacket drapes over his slender frame contrasts with his white dress shirt and black slacks. I recall how 阿婆 would chastize him about always wearing that old tattered jacket -- and in the middle of the summer! 热死你啦！
