# 八十二街

The door hinges open -- a soft release air -- *psst* -- as it closes shut. Sprinkles of embers burn along the paper of the cigarette. A hand pulls it back, grizzly bits of hair litter the recently shaven face of the old man.  A pause as he slowly releases the smoke of tobacco into the faint summer breeze. Pacing back and forth, I stare down at my feet hearing the *click click click* as my shoes make contact on the small cement walkway, imagining that I am marching soldier preparing for a daunting mission. 

I stop and look at the old man, his oversized jacket drapes over his slender frame contrasts with his white dress shirt and black slacks. 阿婆 would chastize him about always wearing that old tattered jacket -- and in the middle of the summer! 热死你啦！ Nevertheless, he scoffed at her naggings -- often sharply rebuking in his soft intonations. He finishes the last bit of his cigarette, discarding it on the concrete floor that I had been marching upon, rubbing it out with the bottom of his Nike sneakers. He quietly walks forward to the driveway, putting his hands on my shoulders and gently guiding me alongside him. We walk past the neighbors fence...*bark bark bark* the snaps of the German Shepard's jaws lurches forward bumping into the metal fence. Fear quickly consumes me as I turn and clamor upon my grandfather's jacket, the lingering scent of nicotine hangs.
