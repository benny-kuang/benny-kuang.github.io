A steady feeling of malcontent is beginning to emerge. Malaise and frustration. Perhaps disappointment in human interactions. Perhaps a self-loathing that is continually to set. Perhaps, merely just the sort of seasonal depression that one speaks of living in the cold and cloudy days of the Pacific Northwest. Regardless, I've been feeling quite uneasy. A slight pange of pain trickles into my head. Yet I feel constant movement. A constant urge to pine and reach forward to. Frustration at a sort of inability to reach forward and further yet to reach forward to feel that it becomes unreceived and unreciprocated. It is all enough to allow myself to dissolve.

My escape has been cinema and literature -- the ways in which the written word and visual image has been framed to formulate a felt sensation. Yet these images are that -- mere images that refract bits and pieces of reality -- how we receive too goes to such a process. Reality is much more complex it seems...and yet even so more simple. It is not as exaggerated as the high soap dramas that are so etiquettely crafted and honed -- yet in our mind it feels so grandiose. Memories echo through, the reality so mundane and inconsequential, but I feel them so much more. Especially at night. The night brings the memories the most. Like a cold chill front that marches through -- it comes unexpectantly and so viciously...Keeping me laying in wake. What to do but drown it out with the infinite scroll of social media...How cliche. I do feel myself echoed into the mind of Prince Myshkin from Dostoevsky's *the Idiot* -- Every interaction I find myself into I cannot help but feel the sense of fraught attempts and when the genuineness springs through, how much regret I feel at my earnestness. And the amount of cringe and grief I feel when I try to feign smiles and interest....Not to say that I am uninterested but I find myself encapsulated and enclosed in these limitations. In these sort of frustrations that ya know it's probably better not to lay out the grand theories of human existence out to every person you interact with.  That's probably pretty jarring when a stranger begins the conversation about capital punishment, right, Myshkin? 

Which what lends back to cinema -- the silver screen! What a grand place! Going that early February...or was it March day to the AMC River East to see Drive My Car...It's something that I will forever hold fondly. I think it was that moment that my love for the *theater* re-emerged -- It was such a pleasant experience riding the L downtown and walking up to the mostly empty theater with my popcorn and soda to the masterful film of Drive My Car. There's nothing like it. Something that is so hard to emulate and re-create. Perhaps I am the only one that enjoys this such...? I know what a freak I must appear to be -- yet who cares? No judgments there!
