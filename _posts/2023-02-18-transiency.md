It is nearly 10 years since my grandpa passed. One of the last videos I have of him is a short clip -- I beckon him to say it, say it. He imitates the sound of the announcer on the MAX train as it arrives to their stop. What compelled me to record this moment not knowing that would be one of the last moments I would have with him? The joy and elation he expresses. It was spurred by a dinner we had beforehand where by happenstance, I, as am oft to do, recollect with my cousins and my grandparents about the days we lived together -- how they raised us and how we would often ride the MAX to different parts of town. My grandpa would say, yes, and when we were about to arrive, I would say to you that we are almost there (in the intontontation of the little train chime).

The train of memory comes and goes....So does those memories of my grandpa begin to fade...Rewatching the clip over and over, remembering and clinging to how he sounded like, how he looked like...seeing it dissipate.

A few years back while working at my parent's restaurant I discovered my dad's old VHS-C camcorder. To my surprise, it worked...sort of. The battery had long died so it would not hold any charge. Additionally there were no tapes in my parent's home to test to see if it works. But I was filled with joy particularly because I remembered me and my cousin had once in our childish mischieviousness recorded my grandpa while he was sleeping. The memories of us putting a cup in his hand as he sat there mouth agaped and giggling endlessly. I was elated to have the chance to see this cherish moment again. It must be back in our new home! 

But it wasn't. A few years before that my family had a major purging project as we planned to move into a new home. Shortly after graduating college, lost and aimless, I was jobless and without real ambitions. This project felt like a thrusting upon by my parents to do something for them when I felt like I could had spent my time doing more important things (like figuring out what the hell I wanted to do with my life -- and that haphazard excuse that I was studying for the LSAT). In my rage about this housecleaning endeavor, I argued with my mom about keeping our collection of old VHS home videos. What's the point of keeping all these old tapes? We don't even have a VCR anymore, how can we possibly watch them? Fine, I will throw them all away then. I remember driving with my brother in a truck we borrowed from our uncle to the dump. The sight of bulldozers pushing clumps of trash into a bigger pit of clumps of trash. The emitting stench swirling outwards. We unloaded the trunk...I set out the bag of tapes and drove away.

I returned home, excited to find the tapes, only to come to this realization. What had been elation quickly became dread, shame, anger. Sadness that my brash moments of anger resulted in the lost of the chance to relive and reconnect with the spirit of my grandfather. 

Recently, I watched Cafe Lumiere a film by the Taiwanese filmmaker Hou Hsiao Hsien as an homage to the Japanese filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu. In it, trains are captured prominently as a set piece and focal point. I am drawn to these moments. Feeling the essence of transiecny that riding a train brings. Solemn, silent -- yet gleeful and whimsical -- adventerous and boundless. The past, present, and future meld into one -- much as I sit and gaze upon my memories. Remembering these exact times I rode the MAX with my grandparents -- feeling the cool A/C, the felt fabric seats. Mesmirized by the spee dand sensing the anticipation of arriving to the mall being able to see all the different toys and videos I would like to buy 

-- to then the memories of an adult, riding along the trains with music in my ears. Heartbroken, detaching myself by riding the train aimlessly to downtown. Originally intended to go to the art museum, only to discover it is closed for an event, I went upon Ground Kontrol, playing a few random arcade games with the rolls of quarters I scavenged at home. Growing tired, I rode back home. How the evanesence of train tracks passing and whizzing seemed to sooth my numb empty body.


How these memories reappear -- revisiting over and over again much as a commuter comes upon the same stops along their destination. The constant yearning and revisiting to such sense memories appear rather sweet while in reality, they are quite bitter. That sweet memory of that sweet memory is fully enclosed and separated -- recursivity upon recursivity like a train passing by stop after stop.

Arrival -- Departure -- Here -- There -- Sadness -- Happiness -- Arrival -- Departure -- Anger -- Happiness -- Arrival -- Departure -- Anger -- Disappointment -- Yearning -- Avoiding

Peering in to the windows
Seeing the reflections that show
Staring out into the world.
Being drawn to the others who board
Trying to drown out any disturbances.
Curious by the faces that sit.
Sweltered and sworn by my own thoughts. 
Engulfed by own anxiety.
Seeking to my destination.
So it be.
Being together in the various trains....Boarding in...Boarding out....
